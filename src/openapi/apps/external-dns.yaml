  x-short: Synchronize exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.
  description: Inspired by Kubernetes DNS, Kubernetes' cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers. Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the Kubernetes API to determine a desired list of DNS records. Unlike KubeDNS, however, it's not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly.
  x-info: |
    ExternalDNS is required to make public service domains accessible by registering them with Otomi's front loadbalancer CNAME or IP address.
    When it is not enabled (default) Otomi will instead rely on [nip.io](https://nip.io) to create host names for the services.
